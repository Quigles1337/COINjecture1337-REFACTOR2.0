# COINjecture REFACTOR - Code Owners
#
# This file defines ownership and review requirements for consensus-critical code.
# Changes to protected paths REQUIRE approval from designated code owners.
#
# Syntax: <path pattern> @owner1 @owner2
# Docs: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners

# ==================== CONSENSUS-CRITICAL PATHS ====================
# These paths gate blockchain consensus and MUST NOT change without:
# 1. Code owner approval
# 2. PR label: "consensus-change"
# 3. Passing parity tests (old hash == new hash)
# 4. Security audit (for major changes)

# Golden test vectors (frozen fixtures for determinism)

# ==================== REVIEW POLICY ====================
#
# Consensus-Critical Changes:
#   - Require PR label: "consensus-change"
#   - Require code owner approval
#   - Must pass parity tests (determinism.yml)
#   - Must pass golden vector tests
#   - Recommended: security audit for major changes
#
# Security-Sensitive Changes:
#   - Require code owner approval
#   - Must pass security.yml workflow
#   - Must include threat model updates
#
# Dependency Updates:
#   - Require code owner approval
#   - Must pass cargo audit / pip-audit / govulncheck
#   - Must update SBOMs
#
# Emergency Hotfixes:
#   - Can bypass approval IF:
#     - Incident commander approval
#     - Post-merge review within 24h
#     - Post-mortem within 48h
