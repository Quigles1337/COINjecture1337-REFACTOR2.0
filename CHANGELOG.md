### Critical Complex Equilibrium Conjecture Attempts
- **Applied Critical Equilibrium Constants**: Multiple attempts with λ = η = 1/√2 ≈ 0.7071
  - Created `scripts/critical_sync.py` for direct A→B synchronization
  - Created `scripts/apply_conjecture_fix.py` for consensus database sync
  - Created `scripts/fix_api_cache_sync.py` for API/Cache synchronization
  - Applied principles from Critical Complex Equilibrium Proof

### Sync Analysis & Attempts
- **Consensus Service**: 19 blocks in database, 19 in blockchain state file
- **API Service**: Still showing 17 blocks, latest block #16
- **Critical Sync**: Successfully synchronized consensus service to 19 blocks
- **API/Cache Issue**: API still not reflecting updated blockchain state

### Technical Implementation
- **Critical Sync Scripts**: Multiple synchronization attempts using equilibrium constants
- **Power Cycle**: Applied conjecture with full service restart
- **Decoupling**: Stopped consensus service, applied conjecture, restarted services
- **Result**: Consensus service has 19 blocks, API still shows block 16

### Files Created
- `scripts/critical_sync.py` - Critical equilibrium synchronization script
- `scripts/apply_conjecture_fix.py` - Consensus database sync with conjecture
- `scripts/fix_api_cache_sync.py` - API/Cache sync with conjecture

### System Status
- **Consensus Service**: ✅ 19 blocks in database and state file
